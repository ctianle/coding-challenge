I believe that speed, security and availability are the main concerns of a transaction broadcaster service, as it holds the private key, and all transactions must be through it to get broadcasted to the blockchain. These transactions are crucial and should be sent to the blockchain promptly to prevent financial loss and ensure timely execution. Please refer to the image under the same directory for the explanations below.

## Weighting
There should be a weighting algorithm that adjusts the gas fee, sign and rebroadcast a transaction. This can help to automatically adjust and increase the gas fee when the network gets congested and to ensure that the transaction goes through, ensuring timely execution. All RPC calls to the blockchain should be asynchronous so that the broadcaster service remains responsive. 
Availability
Availability is very important for a transaction broadcaster service as every critical transaction needs to get through it to go on-chain. Availability can be achieved via Active-Active configuration whereby multiple instances of broadcaster work as a clustered setup. This help ensure that the transaction is sent to an available broadcaster to ensure that they are signed and broadcasted timely.

## Security
In terms of private key storage to ensure security, a separate server that stores the private keys could be utilized to solely sign transactions. This separate server must have good security protocols in place to authenticate the transaction broadcaster server. To further enforce and enhance the security, an additional private-key storage server could be further utilized whereby both private-key server must sign before broadcasting. This helps to ensure that even if 1 private-key server is compromised, there is still the requirement of the other private key to approve a transaction. Furthermore, this helps in providing abstraction for transaction signing whereby the broadcaster server won’t need to worry about the complexity of private key management.

## Modular
Furthermore, the use of numerous broadcaster server to help sign and broadcast the transaction increases the surface area of attack for attackers. This requires meticulous server updates and patching.
With the usage of a separate private key server, any broadcaster servers that get compromised won’t result in the loss of private keys, preventing financial loss. Furthermore, it gets simpler and centralized to monitor and control the private keys. 
Like the importance of availability for the broadcaster server, the private-key server needs to be available to ensure that transactions are signed. Hence, an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup should also be used for private-key storage.

## API Interface
By only exposing an internal API for broadcasting requests by other services, there is abstractions such that the internal workings of the API are not exposed. In a scenario that any internal services get compromised, the attackers won’t understand the internal mechanism of the broadcaster server for further exploitations if any.

## Service Layer
The service layer will be responsible for accepting requests, signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain nodes. Each transaction should be assigned a unique identifier (UUID) and the metadata should be stored in a persistent database such as MongoDB or NoSQL. The metadata should include information such as transaction ID, original request details, transaction status (failed, success, pending), retry count, blockchain response (success or failure). This information can help to provide information to assist in gas fee readjustments and broadcasts.
